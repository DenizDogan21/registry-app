## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
flutter pub get
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, ensure you've set up the required configurations:

1. **Firebase Configuration**: Create a Firebase project and obtain the configuration file (`google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS). Place the file in the `android/app` or `ios/Runner` directory accordingly.

2. **Assets Configuration**: In your `pubspec.yaml` file, include the path to the Firebase configuration file as an asset:

    ```yaml
    # pubspec.yaml
    assets:
      - android/app/google-services.json
      - ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

The application will launch, and you can access it on your emulator or physical device. Explore the different user interfaces and functionalities tailored for the accounting office and technical workers.

## Firebase Integration

This project integrates with Firebase for data storage. Follow these steps to set up Firebase:

1. Initialize Firebase in your Dart code:

    ```dart
    // example Firebase initialization
    void initializeFirebase() {
      Firebase.initializeApp().then((value) {
        print("Firebase Initialized");
      });
    }
    ```

2. Add the necessary Firebase dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: ^1.10.0
      cloud_firestore: ^3.0.0
      # Add other Firebase dependencies as needed
    ```

3. Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured with Firestore for data storage and any other required services.
